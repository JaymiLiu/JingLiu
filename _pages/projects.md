## Research Associate, George Mason University, Sep. 2018 to Aug. 2019  
  Collaborator: [Dr. Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/npark)
+ *Social media data analysis with Graph Neural Networks (GNN)*
  - Processed both unstructured (e.g., textual data) and structured (e.g., friendship relations and retweet records) social media data
  - Customized a bi-directional long short term memory (LSTM) network to embed tweet texts and integrated it with one state-of-the-art graph convolution neural network for predicting the severity of vulnerabilities%, one cyber-security application% moving average to handle the out-of-memory issue for gpu, attention mechanism to get useful tweets
  - Proposed a node-edge co-convolution graph neural network architecture and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting information diffusion (i.e., influence probability) over social networks  
+ *Data augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)*
	- Developed a GAN architecture to synthesize incomplete tabular data with two constraints that are maintaining column-wise statistical means and functional dependencies
	- Improved classification performance with synthesized data and outperformed various state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches
+ *Modeling and accelerating large-scale optimization problems with TensorFlow*
	- Proposed a neural network to model non-linear 0-1 knapsack problem and devised an adaptive gradient ascent method to solve the network 
	- Developed deep neural networks to model and maximize airline market share over air transportation network
