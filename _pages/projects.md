### Research Associate  
  <!---Collaborator: Dr. Noseong Park-->
  George Mason University, Sep. 2018 to Aug. 2019
+ *Social media data analysis with Graph Neural Networks (GNN)*
  - Processed both unstructured (e.g., textual data) and structured (e.g., friendship relations and retweet records) social media data
  - Customized a bi-directional long short term memory (LSTM) network to embed tweet texts and integrated it with one state-of-the-art graph convolution neural network for predicting the severity of vulnerabilities%, one cyber-security application% moving average to handle the out-of-memory issue for gpu, attention mechanism to get useful tweets
  - Proposed a node-edge co-convolution graph neural network architecture and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting information diffusion (i.e., influence probability) over social networks  
+ *Data augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)*
	- Developed a GAN architecture to synthesize incomplete tabular data with two constraints that are maintaining column-wise statistical means and functional dependencies
	- Improved classification performance with synthesized data and outperformed various state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches
+ *Modeling and accelerating large-scale optimization problems with TensorFlow*
	- Proposed a neural network to model non-linear 0-1 knapsack problem and devised an adaptive gradient ascent method to solve the network 
	- Developed deep neural networks to model and maximize airline market share over air transportation network
  
### Research Assistant
  <!---Supervisor: Dr. Ming Lu-->
  University of Alberta, Sep. 2014 to Jul. 2018
+ Dual-Level Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Framework for Prefabrication in Construction
  - Proposed a dual-level multi-project scheduling methodology to improve the resource allocation practice of multiple concurrent projects by enhancing the robustness of derived resource plans
  - Implemented the proposed methodology in *IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio* for proof-of-concept
  - Developed a MS project addon (in C#) for a partner construction company to apply the proposed methodology in scheduling bridge girder fabrication projects

### Research Assistant
  <!---Supervisor: Dr. Fei Qiao-->
  Tsinghua University, Oct. 2010 to Jun. 2014
+ A novel low-complexity video compression method based on Underdetermined Blind Signal Separation (UBSS) and Compressive Sensing (CS)
<!---
+ Developed two video coding frameworks (in Matlab) which weigh recovery quality and decoding time, employed **TV** minimization by **A**ugmented **L**agrangian and **AL**ternating direction **AL**gorithms (TVAL3) as the decoding algorithm
+ Validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with two conventional video coding methods (i.e., H.264 and JPEG) and a well-known low-complexity video compression approach DISCOVER
